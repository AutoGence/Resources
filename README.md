## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3001` with hot reload.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates static content into the `build/` directory that can be served by any static hosting service.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run serve
```

Serves the production build locally at `http://localhost:3001` for testing.

### Clear Cache

```bash
npm run clear
```

Clears Docusaurus cache and generated files. Useful for troubleshooting build issues.
